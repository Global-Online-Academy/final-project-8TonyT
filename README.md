# FINAL PROJECT

This repository is for all of the programs and files needed for my final project.

Include any program files or data files that are needed for me visualizations when submitting to this assignment.


This is my Catalyst Project. My Catalyst Project is How To Anallyze Human Disease Data With Python. I got a dataset from 
data.world and download it and put into my respository. There are 65 disease in total. I choose to draw bar graphs using Bokeh to show you how severe global health is.

We need to built better hospitals and help people in need!

Thanks for your cooporation.
